      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        In Mathematics and Computational Geometry, a Delaunay triangulation
        (also known as a Delone triangulation) for a given set P of discrete
        points in a general position is a triangulation DT(P) such that no point
        in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P). Delaunay
        triangulations maximise the minimum angle of all the angles of the
        triangles in the triangulation; they tend to avoid sliver triangles. The
        triangulation is named after Boris Delaunay for his work on this topic
        from 1934.

        For a set of points on the same line there is no Delaunay triangulation
        (the notion of triangulation is degenerate for this case). For four or
        more points on the same circle (e.g., the vertices of a rectangle) the
        Delaunay triangulation is not unique: each of the two possible
        triangulations that split the quadrangle into two triangles satisfies
        the "Delaunay condition", i.e., the requirement that the circumcircles
        of all triangles have empty interiors.
      </p>
      <p>
        By considering circumscribed spheres, the notion of Delaunay
        triangulation extends to three and higher dimensions. Generalisations
        are possible to metrics other than Euclidean distance. However, in these
        cases a Delaunay triangulation is not guaranteed to exist or be unique.

      <h3>Properties</h3>
      <p>Let n be the number of points and d the number of dimensions.</p>
      <ul>
        <p>
          <li>
            The union of all simplices in the triangulation is the convex hull
            of the points.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>The Delaunay triangulation contains O(n^⌈d / 2⌉) simplices.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            In the plane (d = 2), if there are b vertices on the convex hull,
            then any triangulation of the points has at most 2n - 2 - b
            triangles, plus one exterior face (Euler characteristic).
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            If points are distributed according to a Poisson process in the
            plane with constant intensity, then each vertex has on average six
            surrounding triangles. More generally for the same process in d
            dimensions the average number of neighbours is a constant depending
            only on d.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            In the plane, the Delaunay triangulation maximises the minimum
            angle. Compared to any other triangulation of the points, the
            smallest angle in the Delaunay triangulation is at least as large as
            the smallest angle in any other. However, the Delaunay triangulation
            does not necessarily minimise the maximum angle. The Delaunay
            triangulation also does not necessarily minimise the length of the
            edges.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            A circle circumscribing any Delaunay triangle does not contain any
            other input points in its interior.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            If a circle passing through two of the input points doesn't contain
            any other input points in its interior, then the segment connecting
            the two points is an edge of a Delaunay triangulation of the given
            points.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            Each triangle of the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in
            d-dimensional spaces corresponds to a facet of convex hull of the
            projection of the points onto a (d + 1)-dimensional paraboloid, and
            vice versa.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            The closest neighbour b to any point p is on an edge bp in the
            Delaunay triangulation since the nearest neighbour graph is a
            subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            The Delaunay triangulation is a geometric spanner: In the plane (d =
            2), the shortest path between two vertices, along Delaunay edges, is
            known to be no longer than 1.998 times the Euclidean distance
            between them.
