# Triangulation 2D Demo - Computational Geometry

In geometry, a triangulation is a subdivision of a planar object into triangles, and by extension the subdivision of a higher-dimension geometric object into simplices. Triangulations of a three-dimensional volume would involve subdividing it into tetrahedra packed together.

In most instances, the triangles of a triangulation are required to meet edge-to-edge and vertex-to-vertex.
